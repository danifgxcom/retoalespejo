# Reto al Espejo (Mirror Challenge) - Mono-repo

> Digital implementation of the "Reto al Espejo" puzzle game, originally by Educa. A React-based interactive web application that simulates a physical geometric puzzle game involving symmetry and mirror reflection, now with multiplayer support through a Node.js backend.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Mirror Challenge** is a puzzle game where players place geometric pieces on one side of a mirror line, and the pieces are automatically reflected on the other side. The goal is to recreate specific challenge patterns by strategically positioning, rotating, and flipping pieces to match the target configuration.

## üìÇ Mono-repo Structure

This project is now organized as a mono-repo with separate directories for frontend and backend:

- `frontend/` - Contains the React application for the game interface
- `backend/` - Contains the Node.js server for multiplayer functionality

### Multiplayer Features

The backend adds the following multiplayer capabilities:
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay with Socket.io
- Chat functionality between players in the same room
- Synchronized game timer for all players
- Player elimination on wrong answers
- Winner notification when a player solves the challenge

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

#### Installation
1. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

#### Running the Application
Start both frontend and backend in development mode:
```
npm run dev
```

Start only the frontend:
```
npm run frontend:dev
```

Start only the backend:
```
npm run backend:dev
```

For more detailed information about each part of the application:
- [Frontend Documentation](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend Documentation](./backend/README.md)

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

- **Two piece types**: Type A and Type B (with different geometric shapes)
- **Color combinations**: Yellow center with red triangles, or inverted
- **Face system**: Front/back faces with inverted color schemes
- **Real-time reflection**: Pieces placed in the game area automatically appear reflected
- **Challenge system**: 4+ predefined patterns with increasing difficulty
- **Piece manipulation**: Rotation (90¬∞ increments), face flipping, and drag-and-drop

### Architecture Principles

#### SOLID Design Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one specific concern
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through interfaces without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Services are interchangeable through interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused, minimal interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructors

#### Clean Code Implementation
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and data handling are separated
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level details
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Core functionality organized in specialized services
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict types

## üéØ Game Rules & Validation

### Challenge Validation Rules

The game enforces 6 core validation rules for valid challenge patterns:

1. **Mirror Touch Rule**: At least one piece must touch the mirror line (x=700)
2. **No Piece Overlaps**: Pieces cannot overlap with each other
3. **No Mirror Intrusion**: Pieces cannot cross into the mirror area (x>700)
4. **No Reflection Overlaps**: Pieces cannot overlap with their own reflections
5. **Connectivity Rule**: All pieces must form a continuous connected figure
6. **Area Containment**: All pieces (including reflections) must fit within the challenge area

### Geometric Precision

- **SAT Collision Detection**: Separating Axes Theorem for precise polygon overlap detection
- **Exact Touch Validation**: Sub-pixel precision for mirror touching verification
- **Complex Piece Geometry**: Square with 3 triangular extensions (7 vertices total)
- **Rotation & Transformation**: Full 360¬∞ rotation support with proper bounding box calculations

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Canvas Rendering System

#### Multi-Area Layout
- **Game Area** (0-700px): Player interaction zone
- **Mirror Area** (700-1400px): Automatic reflection display  
- **Piece Storage** (bottom): Available pieces inventory
- **Challenge Card** (bottom-right): Target pattern visualization

#### Coordinate Systems
- **World Coordinates**: Logical game coordinates (0-700 for game area)
- **Canvas Coordinates**: Physical pixel coordinates
- **Viewport Transformations**: Managed by `ViewportManager` for consistent scaling

### State Management

#### React Hooks Architecture
```typescript
// Game state centralized in custom hooks
const gameLogic = useGameLogic(challenges, geometry);
const mouseHandlers = useMouseHandlers(gameLogic, canvasRef);

// State flows unidirectionally
pieces ‚Üí validation ‚Üí rendering ‚Üí user interaction ‚Üí state update
```

#### Service Layer
```typescript
// Dependency injection pattern
const validationService = new ValidationService(geometry);
const challengeService = new ChallengeService(generator, validationService);
const renderingService = new RenderingService(theme);
```

### Challenge System

#### Challenge Loading
- **Primary**: Load from `/public/challenges.json`
- **Fallback**: Embedded challenges in `ChallengeGenerator`
- **Validation**: All challenges validated against game rules
- **Format**: JSON with piece positions, types, rotations, and metadata

#### Challenge Structure

**New Relative Coordinate System (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "coordinate_system": "mirror_relative",
  "challenges": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Heart Simple",
      "pieces": [
        {
          "type": "A",
          "face": "front",
          "x": 0,    // 0 = touches mirror, negative = left of mirror
          "y": 0,    // 0 = vertical center, negative = up, positive = down
          "rotation": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Legacy Absolute Coordinate System:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Challenge Name",
  "objective": {
    "playerPieces": [
      {
        "type": "A|B",
        "face": "front|back", 
        "x": 330,  // Absolute canvas coordinates (confusing)
        "y": 300,
        "rotation": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
