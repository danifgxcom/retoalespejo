## Theme System

A comprehensive theme system has been implemented to provide both a colorful theme and a highly accessible theme:

1. **Theme Switcher Component** (`frontend/src/components/accessibility/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`)
   - Allows users to toggle between colorful and accessible themes
   - Provides clear visual indication of current theme
   - Includes appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers

2. **Theme Context** (`frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)
   - Manages theme state across the application
   - Provides theme toggling functionality
   - Applies appropriate CSS classes to enable theming

3. **Theme CSS** (`frontend/src/styles/theme.css`)
   - Enhanced to support both colorful and accessible themes
   - Colorful theme matches game pieces and challenge thumbnails
   - Accessible theme meets WCAG AA+ standards
   - Both themes maintain proper contrast ratios

For more detailed information, see the [Theme Implementation Documentation](./THEME_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Perform keyboard-only navigation testing
   - Run automated accessibility audits (Axe, Lighthouse)
   - Test theme switching with various assistive technologies

2. **Additional Components**
   - Form inputs and labels
   - Navigation components
   - Tables and data displays

3. **User Testing**
   - Test with users who have disabilities
   - Gather feedback and make improvements
   - Collect feedback specifically on theme preferences

## Conclusion

These accessibility improvements significantly enhance the usability of the application for all users, including those with disabilities. By following W3C AA standards, we've created a more inclusive user experience that benefits everyone.

The latest improvements focused on:
1. Simplifying the color palette to reduce visual complexity
2. Adding proper ARIA attributes to all buttons, especially "Reanudar" (Resume) and "Reset" buttons
3. Making icons aria-hidden="true" to prevent redundant screen reader announcements
4. Ensuring all interactive elements have clear and descriptive labels

These changes ensure that the application is more accessible to users with visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, and those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.
