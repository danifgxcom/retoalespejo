# Accessibility Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to the application to ensure compliance with W3C AA standards. The goal is to make the application usable by people with various disabilities, including visual, motor, auditory, and cognitive impairments.

## Components Updated

### Button Component
**Issues Fixed:**
- Added proper ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-describedby)
- Added proper button type attribute
- Improved focus styles for keyboard navigation
- Enhanced icon-only buttons with proper accessibility
- Made icons aria-hidden="true" to prevent screen readers from announcing them
- Added spacing between icon and text when both are present

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
<Button
  onClick={handleClick}
  ariaLabel="Add new item"
  type="button"
  variant="primary"
>
  Add Item
</Button>

// For icon-only buttons
<Button
  onClick={handleClose}
  ariaLabel="Close dialog"
  icon={X}
/>
```

### Modal Component
**Issues Fixed:**
- Added proper ARIA roles (role="dialog", aria-modal="true")
- Implemented focus management to trap focus within the modal
- Added keyboard support to close with Escape key
- Added aria-labelledby and aria-describedby connections
- Improved close button accessibility
- Implemented focus return when modal is closed
- Used createPortal for better DOM placement

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
<Modal
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={handleClose}
  title="Settings"
  subtitle="Configure your preferences"
>
  {/* Modal content */}
</Modal>
```

### Card Component
**Issues Fixed:**
- Added keyboard navigation for interactive cards
- Added proper ARIA attributes
- Added role attribute for semantic HTML
- Added focus styles for keyboard navigation
- Added tabIndex for keyboard focus
# Accessibility Improvements Documentation

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to the application to ensure compliance with W3C AA standards. The goal is to make the application usable by people with various disabilities, including visual, motor, auditory, and cognitive impairments.

## Getting Started with Accessibility Testing

To run the automated accessibility tests:

```bash
# Instalar dependencias
npm install

# Ejecutar pruebas de accesibilidad
npm run test:a11y

# Ejecutar pruebas de integración de accesibilidad
npm run test:a11y:integration

# Ejecutar análisis de Lighthouse
npm run lighthouse:a11y
```

## Components and Utilities

### SkipLink

The `SkipLink` component allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to the main content:

```jsx
import { SkipLink } from './components/accessibility';

<SkipLink targetId="main-content" label="Skip to main content" />
```

Ensure your main content has the corresponding ID:

```jsx
<main id="main-content">
  {/* Your content */}
</main>
```

### LiveRegion and useAnnounce

The `LiveRegion` component and `useAnnounce` hook allow you to announce dynamic changes to screen readers:

```jsx
import { LiveRegion, useAnnounce } from './components/accessibility';

// In your root component
<LiveRegion />

// In any component where you need to make announcements
function GameComponent() {
  const announce = useAnnounce();

  const handleLevelComplete = () => {
    // Announce to screen readers
    announce('¡Nivel completado! Avanzando al siguiente nivel.');
    // Rest of your code...
  };

  return (
    // Your component JSX
  );
}
```

### VisuallyHidden

The `VisuallyHidden` component allows you to provide context for screen readers without visual clutter:

```jsx
import { VisuallyHidden } from './components/accessibility';

<button>
  <span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
  <VisuallyHidden>Cerrar diálogo</VisuallyHidden>
</button>
```

## CSS Utilities

### Theme System

The application uses a comprehensive theme system with CSS variables that support:

- Light and dark modes via `prefers-color-scheme`
- High contrast mode via `forced-colors`
- Reduced motion via `prefers-reduced-motion`

Use the predefined variables to maintain accessibility:

```css
.my-element {
  background-color: var(--color-surface);
  color: var(--color-text);
  border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
}
```

### Focus Styles

Custom focus styles are provided that work across different browsers and input methods:

```css
:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid var(--color-focus);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Screen Reader Utilities

Use these CSS classes to create content specifically for screen readers:

```css
/* Visible only to screen readers */
.sr-only { ... }

/* Make sr-only content visible again */
.not-sr-only { ... }
```

## ARIA Attributes

Use these ARIA attributes consistently across the application:

### Buttons

```jsx
<button 
  aria-label="Close dialog" 
  aria-describedby="close-description"
>
  ×
</button>
<div id="close-description" className="sr-only">
  Closes the dialog and discards any unsaved changes
</div>
```

### Forms

```jsx
<div role="group" aria-labelledby="group-label">
  <div id="group-label">Shipping Options</div>
  <div role="radiogroup" aria-required="true">
    {/* Radio buttons here */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Best Practices

### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be focusable
- Focus order should follow logical document flow
- Avoid using positive tabindex values
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Screen Reader Support

- Ensure all images have appropriate alt text
- Use ARIA landmarks to aid navigation
- Announce dynamic content changes
- Provide context for ambiguous links and buttons

### Color and Contrast

- Use sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Support high contrast mode and dark mode
- Test with color blindness simulators

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify all interactive elements are focusable with keyboard
- [ ] Test with NVDA on Windows
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver on macOS/iOS
- [ ] Verify sufficient color contrast
- [ ] Test at 200% zoom
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Run automated tests (axe, Lighthouse)

</Card>
```

### ChallengeThumbnail Component
**Issues Fixed:**
- Added descriptive text for screen readers
- Added proper ARIA attributes
- Added keyboard navigation support
- Added role="img" or role="button" based on interactivity
- Made canvas aria-hidden="true" to prevent screen readers from announcing it
- Added visually hidden description for screen readers

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
<ChallengeThumbnail
  challenge={challenge}
  alt="Mirror challenge with 5 pieces"
  interactive={true}
  onClick={handleChallengeSelect}
/>
```

## General Accessibility Improvements

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are now focusable and operable via keyboard
- Focus styles are visible and consistent across the application
- Focus trapping in modals prevents keyboard users from accessing background content

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper ARIA attributes added to all components
- Alternative text for visual content
- Semantic HTML structure
- Hidden descriptive text for complex visual elements

### Color Contrast
- Ensured sufficient contrast ratios for text and UI elements
- Added focus indicators that don't rely solely on color

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

### Forms and Input Elements
- Ensure all form fields have associated labels
- Add error messages that are announced by screen readers
- Implement form validation that provides clear feedback

### Navigation
- Implement skip links to bypass repetitive navigation
- Ensure consistent navigation patterns
- Add breadcrumbs for complex navigation structures

### Content
- Ensure all images have alt text
- Provide captions for video content
- Use headings in a logical hierarchy

### Testing
- Conduct regular accessibility audits using tools like Axe or Lighthouse
- Test with actual screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Perform keyboard-only navigation testing
- Test with users who have disabilities
